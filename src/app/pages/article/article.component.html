    <p class="article_text">If you really enjoy spending your vacation ‘on water’ or would like to try something new and
        exciting for the first time, then you can consider a houseboat vacation. There are so many fun things to do and
        so many great landscapes to see on a houseboat vacation! But before making further plans, let’s take a look at
        the options that you have for a low-cost vacation on water: you could rent a houseboat this year and try out an
        altogether exotic kind of vacation this year, or you could indulge in a houseboat timeshare.</p>
    <p class="article_text"> What is a houseboat timeshare? Most people who have used a houseboat timeshare say that it
        is a great way to
        spend your vacation at a very high-quality resort, in a place where you couldn’t get reservations so easily that
        too at a very low price! Doesn’t that sound great? But let’s see how and why houseboat timeshares can offer you
        with such fabulous opportunities of low-cost vacationing on water.</p>

        <div class="quote_text">Las Vegas has more than 100,000 hotel rooms to choose from. There is something for every
            budget, and enough
            entertainment within walking distance to keep anyone occupied for months, never mind the usual weekend stay
            or honeymoon.</div>

    <p class="article_text">The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) on Saturday began distributing cards at
        airports receiving flights returning directly from Hong Kong warning travelers returning to the United States
        from Hong Kong & Guangdong Province, People’s Republic of China & Hanoi, Vietnam that they may have been exposed
        to cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</p>
    <p class="article_text">The cards are being handed out by quarantine officials at Chicago, O’Hare International
        Airport; Los Angeles; old York City, JFK International Airport; Newark; & San Francisco. These airports are the
        only U.S. airports receiving direct flights from Hong Kong. No U.S. airports receive direct flights from Hanoi
        or the Guangdong Province. CDC officials expect to expand the distribution of cards to Anchorage, Alaska & the
        territory of Guam later today.</p>

    <p class="article_text">Now, if you are interested in being the best player, getting really good money and knowing
        some tricks and advices of what to do in a live tournament games, here is the best place to learn them.</p>
    <p class="article_text_bold">1) Try not to get drunk</p>
    <p class="article_text">Some of the people that are playing, and that have few rounds to play in the tournament
        don’t count the drinks they have during their games and at the very end of the day they don’t have power to
        continue till the last game, which is a pity to loose such a big opportunity, so, don’t drink a lot and be
        prepare for the last round, also come up with all your senses in order. If you drink, do it measurable and just
        to loose the nerves before the games but also have some other drinks like soda, water, coffee and others to
        hydrate your self. 2) Is it important where I sit? Yes it is, in a tournament try not to sit next to the dealer,
        take a place in where you will feel that you are in front of the dealer to have the feeling that he is giving
        you a game. Also in a place where you will feel comfortable with your self and you will have a perspective of
        the other players.</p>
    <p class="article_text_bold"></p>
    <p class="article_text_bold">2) Make your self comfortable while playing</p>
    <p class="article_text">Don’t show the other players with your position what you cards are telling you. Make sure to
        seat back and relax, don’t adopt positions that will make you move too much or feel uncomfortable during the
        time of the game. Some players in the tournaments show their game with the position they adopt while playing
        either putting the elbows on the table or resting in the bumper. 4) Do the most important thing in the brake.
    </p>
    <p class="article_text">Don’t get distracted from what you really need to do in the brake. Take your time to go to
        the bathroom and rest, sometimes the discussions about the previous game or lines for getting drinks will waste
        your time for what is really important.</p>
    <p class="article_text_bold">3) Also your words and mimic are important during the game.</p>
    <p class="article_text">When ever you are playing don’t show your cards to the other player in the way you talk or
        look, is important that they will have other impression, for example in your hand Is good you can try on making
        faces or saying words that show that your hand is not good, then people will think you have a bad game and you
        will surprise them at the end. This doesn’t work all the time so try to find different ways to hide your
        game.Also you can read the other player’s movements and words to see either they are lying or telling the truth
        in the hand.</p>
    <p class="article_text">The rules of travel have altered so much in the last few years, with strict regulation
        regarding air travel, questionable car searches that may vary in regulation from state to state, and the feeling
        of never really being ultimately sure what is appropriate or improper in the travel world any longer. In most
        cases, if you decide to fly the formerly affable skies, your airline or airport website will have an accurate
        and up to date list regarding what is okay and what is not okay regarding your luggage. As if packing for a trip
        wasnt difficult enough, now we all have to do it with cloudy and blurry regulations and a list we print out from
        the airlines.</p>
    <p class="article_text">The first measure of travel complacency is simple; dont try to squeeze on a carry on that
        you know is not really a carry on. You will get yourself into the frustrating position of trying to argue your
        way onto the airplane with an large bag that just wont do. Youre not going to succeed. Once upon a time you
        would, but not anymore. Now, you will simply be forced to check it and risk being charged an additional fee for
        having too many luggage items. Plus, youre going to end up travelling without your usual band of comfort items
        that you could have had if you just scaled down into standard sized carry on luggage. The simple fact is that
        there used to be wiggle room, and now, there is none.</p>

                    extremely helpful in making some of those choices. We are active people so had no issue with walking
                    from the place to Darling Harbour, the Royal Botanic Garden, and Circular Quay. We would highly
                    recommend staying here. In fact, we hope to do so again in a few weeks!</p>

            <div class="beliefs_text">Initially the concept of timeshare appeared somewhere in the 1960’s in France. The
                principle of a timeshare actually marketed the concept of ‘buying the hotel’ for vacationing. Indeed,
                timeshare is a form of real estate ownership, more precisely vacation property ownership. The owners
                divide the costs of running the resort and also the use of the place between themselves. This timeshare
                concept was first applied to land-resorts, but nowadays, we have all kinds of vacation properties,
                including houseboats. Houseboat timeshare works on a very simple principle.
                <br><br>
                All 52 weeks of the year are divided between the owners (usually there are 51, considering that one week
                should remain for maintenance)! So they can own the resort on a 1/51 basis and can use the resort one
                week per year. Of course, one can buy as many houseboat timeshares as he/she wants to.</div>
